### Background

Little Llama is a fun and fast paced platform game. The player controls a jumping llama who has to jump to and from moving clouds with the goal of reaching coins, all while avoiding flying an bouncing pigs that are out to get him. This game was created using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

### How to play

The gameplay is simple. Use the up arrow to jump, left and right arrows to move horizontally. Jump from cloud to cloud and reach the spinning coin. Once the coin is obtained, a new coin will appear randomly on the screen. The goal is to see how many coins can be obtained before the llama runs out of health. Colliding with the flying pigs results in the deduction of a health point. The llama starts with 5 health points. Other objects will periodically appear on the screen and obtaining give different results. Tacos will change the llama to green and him better jumping abilities for 10 seconds. Stars turn the llama yellow and make him invincible for 10 seconds. A mud ball gets rid of one pig. Lastly, a heart will give llama an additional health point.
